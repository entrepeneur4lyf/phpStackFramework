# PHP Stack Framework

A comprehensive, scalable, and feature-rich PHP framework designed for modern web application development. This framework focuses on performance, scalability, and developer experience, incorporating advanced features like real-time updates, AI integration, distributed computing, and event-driven architecture.

## Key Features

1. **Scalability by Design**: Built to handle growth with distributed caching, clustering support, and efficient update mechanisms.
2. **Efficient Resource Use**: Advanced caching, asynchronous job processing, and optimized update strategies.
3. **Unopinionated Data Storage**: Flexible database layer with ORM and repository pattern support.
4. **AI as Infrastructure**: Built-in support for integrating AI capabilities.
5. **Resilient State Persistence**: Robust state management with recovery mechanisms, distributed locking, and event sourcing.
6. **Real-time Capabilities**: WebSocket support, real-time component updates, and persistent event system for handling disconnections.
7. **Server-Side Rendering**: Efficient rendering with real-time updates, minimizing client-side complexity.
8. **Modular and Extensible**: Easy to add new features or customize existing ones through component-based architecture.
9. **Performance-Focused**: Various optimizations including caching strategies, diff-based updates, and distributed systems.
10. **Developer-Friendly**: Clear structure, comprehensive documentation, and helpful development tools.
11. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Robust event system with synchronous and asynchronous handling, persistence, and real-time streaming.
12. **Secure Communication**: JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization for both HTTP and WebSocket connections.

## Core Components

1. **Core Framework Structure**: Modular architecture with dependency injection, service providers, and routing.
2. **Database Abstraction and ORM**: Flexible database layer with query building and ORM capabilities.
3. **Advanced Component-Based Templating**: Reusable components with real-time updates and efficient rendering.
4. **State Management and Persistence**: Centralized state management with recovery and persistence mechanisms.
5. **Caching and Queue Systems**: Advanced caching with tagging and distributed queue system for background jobs.
6. **Event System and Real-time Streaming**: Robust event handling with persistence and real-time client updates.
7. **AI Integration**: Built-in support for AI services and models.
8. **Clustering and Scalability**: Support for distributed systems with load balancing and coordination.
9. **Security Features**: CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and advanced authentication/authorization systems.
10. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive support for unit, integration, and performance testing.
11. **CLI Tools and Commands**: Console component for creating and managing CLI commands.
12. **Logging and Monitoring**: Extensive logging system and performance monitoring tools.
13. **Development Tools**: Debug toolbar, code compilation, and asset management utilities.
