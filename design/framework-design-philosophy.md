# Custom PHP Framework: Design Philosophy

## Core Principles

1. Scalability by Design
2. Efficient Resource Use by Design
3. Unopinionated Data Storage by Type
4. AI as Infrastructure
5. Clustering without Insanity
6. Resilient State Persistence

### 6. Resilient State Persistence

- **Checkpointing**: Implement a system for creating and managing checkpoints of application state.
- **State Recovery**: Design mechanisms for recovering state after crashes or connection disruptions.
- **Distributed State**: Support distributed state management for cluster environments.
- **Event Sourcing**: Utilize event sourcing patterns to reconstruct state from a series of events.
- **Idempotent Operations**: Design operations to be idempotent, allowing for safe retries after failures.

Implementation strategies:
- Develop a transaction log for capturing state changes
- Implement a snapshot system for efficient state recovery
- Create a distributed state store for cluster-wide state management
- Design a recovery manager to handle crash recovery and state reconstruction
- Implement idempotency keys for all critical operations

## Guiding Principles for Development

[Previous content remains the same, with the addition of:]

6. **Resilience**: Design all components with failure in mind. Implement proper error handling, retry mechanisms, and state recovery procedures.

By adhering to this philosophy, we aim to create a framework that is not only powerful and efficient but also resilient and capable of maintaining state integrity even in the face of failures or disruptions.
